<h1>Reflection #01: Plato's Cave</h1>
<p>I use photography as a way to express both my confidence and my creativity. When I take or create images, I am not just documenting what I see, but also shaping how I want the world to see me. Photography gives me the freedom to experiment with light, color, perspective, and composition, which allows me to build confidence in my own artistic voice. Each image becomes a reflection of how I feel and what I want to communicate, whether it’s strength or individuality. By practicing photography while on my own in different settings, I have learned to step outside of my comfort zone, take risks, and share pieces of myself in ways I have never before.
Beyond self-expression, photography also provides me with a way to engage with the world around me. In many moments, our world is full of different twists and turns. I use photography to capture those contrasts. For example, I usually photograph a variety of different everyday people, cityscapes, or nature while I roam around the world. I create work that only documents my reality but also reimagines it. Throughout my life, my creativity has changed and my love for photography has grown ever more, I have an appreciation for it like never before, Pictures tell a million different stories and I find it so interesting to look back on mine and see what different perspectives I can find. To me, capturing images and creating graphics is a way of translating thoughts, emotions, and ideas into something visible and lasting. Every time I take a photo, I feel like I get to hold onto the details, moods, and perspectives that feel meaningful to me. Photography is not just about what is in front of the lens—it is also about how I choose to frame it, the angle I select, and the feeling I want to convey. It becomes a reflection of my confidence and my creativity, because each choice I make reflects my decisions and thought process. It shows how I think, how I feel, and how I work. I take a great deal of pride in the work I do and like anyone else I want to put my best work out there. As Susan Sontag writes in On Photography, “To collect photographs is to collect the world.” This idea resonates with me because I always feel either sad or happy when looking back on photos I've taken in the past. I am sad because the moment is past and I wish I could revisit it. Or I am joyful because I captured such a beautiful moment and I will remember it forever through my photos. I have the freedom to experiment, to take risks, and to find new ways of expressing myself while also creating moments frozen in time that will live in my memory forever </body>

<h1>Reflection #02: AI Slop</h1>
<p>
In this article by Nesrine Malik talks about the way AI is changing the world as it advances and becomes more complex and intelligent. The regular day to day basis consumption of AI has become more dangerous because it is getting more difficult to find what is real or fabricated on the internet. The apps and social media platforms have integrated more AI into their spaces and this has made reality irrelevant and not actually real. People are forgetting these scenarios or circumstances that are made by AI are not reality and have worsened differences between political parties. The article warns that AI outputs are not neutral. Since they draw on biased training data, they often reinforce nostalgic, conservative, and exclusionary worldviews. This bias manifests in endless imagery that favors patriarchal or white-centric ideals, which dovetails with reactionary political movements. Meanwhile, social media platforms benefit from this flood of content because their business models thrive on engagement and attention, not truth. In this way, AI slop becomes both a cultural and economic force, overwhelming fact-based media with easily produced, emotionally charged fiction. Malik concludes that the real danger lies in our growing desensitization. With reality and fantasy constantly collapsing into each other, public trust in images. Wars, political corruption, and climate disasters risk being reduced to memes or fantastical distractions, muting urgency and numbing collective will. The world, she argues, is “sleepwalking into disaster,” not because we lack knowledge, but because the very tools we use to understand reality are being saturated with illusion. Malik emphasizes the need for people to become more aware of what is real and what is fake. Malik also discusses how this makes it harder for us to trust the media/internet. If the audience can't recognize reality from fiction, any media released will be automatically assumed to be fake. Ai may seem harmless and just something we can do to play around with the internet. But Ai has become manipulative and unreliable.

<h1>Reflection #03: MotherHood stories </h1>
<p> The story I chose from the Motherhood in crisis graphic novel series, is Heela, the school girl with a stolen future. Heela is a student worried about not “bleeding” as in getting her menstrual cycle. She presumed she was pregnant and began to think about what the next options were. For instance, an abortion or keeping the child. She is also considering how having a child will affect her life completely. She won't be able to finish school and become a nurse. She then goes into more detail about the circumstances around her pregnancy. As in her being forced to have intercourse with a man and this man running off after he found out she was pregnant. She continues to worry about the future but is hopeful and happy about her baby. Heela’s story is tragic but also emblematic. This story is about a girl with a future pursuing school, whose path is derailed by pregnancy but not by choice. Unfortunately, she’s left facing a new life that doesn’t offer the same opportunities. The illustrations compared to the photographs feel more empathic towards Heela circumstances. The photographs feel very raw and exposed. The illustrated images let the viewer have a better connection with the story. The advantages the illustrations give in comparison to the photographs because they protect her identity, make abstract emotions visible. Lastly, it allows viewers to get a sense of her inner world in a way that plain text or photography can not.
