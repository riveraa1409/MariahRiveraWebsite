<h1>Reflection #01: Plato's Cave</h1>
<p>I use photography as a way to express both my confidence and my creativity. When I take or create images, I am not just documenting what I see, but also shaping how I want the world to see me. Photography gives me the freedom to experiment with light, color, perspective, and composition, which allows me to build confidence in my own artistic voice. Each image becomes a reflection of how I feel and what I want to communicate, whether it’s strength or individuality. By practicing photography while on my own in different settings, I have learned to step outside of my comfort zone, take risks, and share pieces of myself in ways I have never before.
Beyond self-expression, photography also provides me with a way to engage with the world around me. In many moments, our world is full of different twists and turns. I use photography to capture those contrasts. For example, I usually photograph a variety of different everyday people, cityscapes, or nature while I roam around the world. I create work that only documents my reality but also reimagines it. Throughout my life, my creativity has changed and my love for photography has grown ever more, I have an appreciation for it like never before, Pictures tell a million different stories and I find it so interesting to look back on mine and see what different perspectives I can find. To me, capturing images and creating graphics is a way of translating thoughts, emotions, and ideas into something visible and lasting. Every time I take a photo, I feel like I get to hold onto the details, moods, and perspectives that feel meaningful to me. Photography is not just about what is in front of the lens—it is also about how I choose to frame it, the angle I select, and the feeling I want to convey. It becomes a reflection of my confidence and my creativity, because each choice I make reflects my decisions and thought process. It shows how I think, how I feel, and how I work. I take a great deal of pride in the work I do and like anyone else I want to put my best work out there. As Susan Sontag writes in On Photography, “To collect photographs is to collect the world.” This idea resonates with me because I always feel either sad or happy when looking back on photos I've taken in the past. I am sad because the moment is past and I wish I could revisit it. Or I am joyful because I captured such a beautiful moment and I will remember it forever through my photos. I have the freedom to experiment, to take risks, and to find new ways of expressing myself while also creating moments frozen in time that will live in my memory forever </body>
