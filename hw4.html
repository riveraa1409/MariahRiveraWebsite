For the first photo collage I wanted to convey an environmental issue that was known by the public but also not focused on enough to plan a solution for this issue. The environmental issue I chose was global warming. It was something we often joke about as ordinary citizens of the world but we can see it being more and more present in our lives over the years. One photo is from a wildfire in California. I used this because it is a recurring and serious problem on the west coast of our country and has done significant damage to our lands and fields. The main image, you can see in the center of Antarctica as of 2024. There is a lot more ocean than iceberg in this photo because temperatures are rising dramatically. Lastly the photo on the right is of what Antarctica looked like back in 2001, the wildlife and land was flourishing and thriving. I used a layer mask technique in photoshop to blend the edges of the photos into the center image. I changed the brush size and hardness to give a more blended look. I showed less of the image of the penguins because it represents the past and what it is fading away. </p></i>

In the second photo collage, I thought of typical social and economic issues but I wanted to convey a more current problem that we are facing today. I went with inflation, this issue has been dramatically affecting all ages around our country. All over news and social media sites you can see the anger and frustration of inflation prices. It has now become a known fact that young adults between ages 21 to 28 are not able to buy their own house because of inflation. Its a reality we are unfortunately living in right now and hopefully it will be solved soon. In this photo collage I wanted to try to make it more complex and abstract. I put the images over one another because I believe it gives the sense of how it starts and how it ends. Meaning the image I blended with a layer mask tool in the center shows a homeless woman laying on the street. I wanted to show that from protesting to spending more money can lead to sadness and despair. Such as losing your home or savings. I feel it also shows the lesson many often speak of that money is root to all evil.</body>
